# Ecohydrological Multi-Objective Optimization with Graph Neural Networks

This repository presents a robust, extensible framework for ecohydrological modeling using graph neural networks (GNNs), multi-task regression, and multi-objective optimization. Designed to address the challenge of balancing flood and drought mitigation in global basins, this project integrates domain-specific hydrological knowledge, GNN-based regression modeling, and evolutionary optimization using NSGA-II.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset Preparation

```bash
# Step 1: Generate multi-label dataset
python data_utils/multi_label_dataset.py

# Step 2: Generate adversarial split masks for each basin
python data_utils/adversarial_split.py  # or adversarial_split_multi.py
```

---

## ðŸš€ Training

Train all models across all labels (FRI, DRI, or both):
```bash
python train_model.py
```

Results will be saved to `results/` including:
- Best model weights: `best_model_{MODEL}_{LABEL}.pth`
- Training logs: `train_log_{MODEL}_{LABEL}.csv`
- Loss curves: `loss_curve_{MODEL}_{LABEL}.png`
- TensorBoard logs: `tensorboard/{MODEL}_{LABEL}/`

### Training Configurations (in `train_model.py`):
```python
LABELS = ['FRI', 'DRI']           # or ['FRI'], or ['DRI'], or ['FRI', 'DRI']
MODEL_TYPES = ['GCN', 'GAT', 'GIN', 'GT']
MULTI_TASK = True                # Use FRI + DRI together
HIDDEN_DIM = 256                 # 128, 256, or 512
NUM_EPOCHS = 100
```

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Optimization (NSGA-II)

Once trained, you may run multi-objective optimization:
```bash
python ndmo.py
```
This will use the trained GNNs to compute FRI and DRI for multiple candidate flow solutions, then apply non-dominated sorting + crowding distance to extract Pareto fronts.

---

## ðŸ“Š Explainability

Run the GNNExplainer to obtain node and edge importance:
```bash
python tools/explainer_gat.py   # or explainer_gcn.py
```

To convert `.npy` importance maps to `.csv`:
```bash
python tools/importance.py
```

Visualizations are saved to `GNNExplainer/figs/`.
